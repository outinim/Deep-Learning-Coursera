# Coursera Deep Learning Specialization 

Repository with all my work (notebooks, code, images) from the [coursera lectures](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) of deep learning specializations of [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

## Introduction

*In five courses, you will learn the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects. You will learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. You will work on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. You will master not only the theory, but also see how it is applied in industry. You will practice all these ideas in Python and in TensorFlow, which we will teach.*

### Course 5: Sequence Models
  
  Objectives:
  - Understand how to build and train Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and commonly-used variants such as GRUs and LSTMs.
  - Be able to apply sequence models to natural language problems, including text synthesis. 
  - Be able to apply sequence models to audio applications, including speech recognition and music synthesis.
